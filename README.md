This repository contains matlab program files that reproduces the results of numerical simulations presented in the research work "Cultural tightness and resilience against environmental shocks in nonindustrial societies".

Experiment.m is a Matlab implementation of the model. It uses Create_shocks_v1s.m for creating environmental shocks and utility_v1s.m for calculating a utility function of an agent.
